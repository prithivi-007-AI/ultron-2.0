AI Voice Assistant

Overview
This AI Voice Assistant is a Python-based project that enables users to interact with their personal assistant using voice commands. It can play YouTube videos, navigate PowerPoint slides, engage in casual conversations using GPT-2, and remember past interactions.

Features
- Voice Recognition: Uses `speech_recognition` to convert speech to text.
- Text-to-Speech: Uses `pyttsx3` for assistant responses.
- GPT-2 Integration: Generates conversational responses using a pre-trained GPT-2 model.
- YouTube Video Playback: Plays YouTube videos based on voice commands via `pywhatkit`.
- PowerPoint Slide Navigation: Controls slides using `pyautogui`.
- Chat History Management: Remembers past interactions and retrieves responses.

Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

pip install torch transformers pyttsx3 speechrecognition pywhatkit pyautogui

Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Voice-Assistant.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   cd AI-Voice-Assistant
3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the script:
   python assistant.py

Usage
- Start the assistant by running the script.
